👨🏻‍💻I'm a final year postgraduate student at Techinacl University of Denmark.I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research interests include multimodal learning, such as the defense for security multimodal large lanuage models(MLLM), datasets for multimodal model security, and other work related to MLLM. I am also interested in weakly supervised learning and have worked on multimodal projects related to it, such as weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and weakly supervised segmentation (RES).Specifically, I am very interested in the inference and training alignment of MLLMs. Currently, MLLMs add a pretrained LLM with an image encoder, which can cause misalignment when image tokens are added to the original LLM, leading to a series of security-related issues in MLLMs.This misalignment not only affects the model's accuracy and reliability but also exposes vulnerabilities that can be exploited, posing significant risks to the security and robustness of these systems.

📝I am currently working on project: Mixture-of-visual-experts for weakly supervised REC
