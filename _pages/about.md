👨🏻‍💻I'm a First-Year NLP PhD student at MBZUAI supervised by [Prof. Yova Kementchedjhieva](https://yovakem.github.io/). I am also closely working with my friend [Yaxin Luo](https://yaxin9luo.github.io/). I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research interests center on multimodal learning. I am passionate about AI agents, particularly autonomous agents and multi-agent systems, and committed to enhancing their foundational capabilities—specifically in memory, reasoning, and interaction. Additionally, I have a keen interest in visual language perception, especially in the interpretation of images and videos. My work also extends to weakly supervised learning, where I have worked on projects like weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES).
