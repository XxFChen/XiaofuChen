👨🏻‍💻I'm a First-Year NLP PhD student at MBZUAI supervised by [Prof. Yova Kementchedjhieva](https://yovakem.github.io/). I am also closely working with my friend [Yaxin Luo](https://yaxin9luo.github.io/). I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research focuses on Multimodal Learning and Representation Learning, with a particular emphasis on fine-grained alignment and interpretable representations across images, text, and video. I aim to move beyond coarse understanding toward reliable distinction and verification of fine details, applying these capabilities to dense image/video captioning and temporal event understanding. I also focus on multimodal evaluation and factual consistency, developing detail-sensitive metrics and benchmarks.
