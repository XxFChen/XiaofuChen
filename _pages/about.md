👨🏻‍💻I'm a Visiting Researcher at MBZUAI supervised by [Prof. Yova Kementchedjhieva](https://yovakem.github.io/).I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research interests lie in multimodal learning, particularly in visual language perception for images and videos, such as localization, segmentation, and video understanding. Additionally, I am keen on exploring the theoretical foundations and efficiency improvements of large models. My work also extends to weakly supervised learning, where I have worked on projects like weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES).
