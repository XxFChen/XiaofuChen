👨🏻‍💻I'm a final year postgraduate student at Techinacl University of Denmark.I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research interests encompass multimodal learning, particularly visual language perception in images and videos (localization/segmentation) and video understanding. Additionally, I am keen on exploring the efficiency aspects of large models. I have also delved into weakly supervised learning, working on multimodal projects like weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and weakly supervised segmentation (RES).


📝I am currently working on project: Mixture-of-visual-experts for weakly supervised REC
