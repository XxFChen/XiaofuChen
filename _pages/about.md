👨🏻‍💻I'm a final year postgraduate student at Techinacl University of Denmark.I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research interests include multimodal learning, such as visual language perception in images/videos (localization/segmentation), video understanding, and I am also interested in the efficiency aspects of large models. I am also interested in weakly supervised learning and have worked on multimodal projects related to it, such as weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and weakly supervised segmentation (RES).


📝I am currently working on project: Mixture-of-visual-experts for weakly supervised REC
