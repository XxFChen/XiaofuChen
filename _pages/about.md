👨🏻‍💻I'm a final year postgraduate student at Techinacl University of Denmark. I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of [Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

📔My research interests lie in multimodal learning, particularly in visual language perception for images and videos, such as localization, segmentation, and video understanding. Additionally, I am keen on exploring the theoretical foundations and efficiency improvements of large models. My work also extends to weakly supervised learning, where I have worked on projects like weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES). 

📖I am currently working on projects:

Post-Training Pruning for Efficient LLM Deployment on Mobile Devices with Prof.Guosheng Hu

Publications:

📄DViR: Dynamic Visual Routing for Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension(submitted to AAAI 2025)( first author)


📄APL: Anchor-based Prompt Learning for One-stage Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension(ECCV 2024)
