I'm a final year postgraduate student at Techinacl University of Denmark.I am so glad to do research projects under the supervision of[Prof. Dimitrios Papadopoulos](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dimpapa/) and [Prof.Weizhi Meng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OlepJ5wAAAAJ).

My research interests include multimodal learning, such as the defense for security multimodal large lanuage models(MLLM), datasets for multimodal model security, and other work related to MLLM. I am also interested in weakly supervised learning and have worked on multimodal projects related to it, such as weakly supervised referring expression comprehension (REC) and weakly supervised segmentation (RES).Specifically, I am very interested in the inference and training alignment of MLLMs. Currently, MLLMs add a pretrained LLM with an image encoder, which can cause misalignment when image tokens are added to the original LLM, leading to a series of security-related issues in MLLMs.
