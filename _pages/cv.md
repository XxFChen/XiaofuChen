Projects
======
* Flash-SAM: Knowledge Distillation For Segment Anything (Advanced Computer Vision Course project).
By experimenting with feature-based and logits-based distillation methods for the SAM model's image encoder, and ultimately using the feature-based approach along with a newly proposed feature adapter, the results surpassed those of MobileSAM.
 Roles in charge: 
  * Collect, read and analysis the paper from this research area and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each pathway to find novel ideas with supervisor
  * Implement and improve the research ideas and conduct extensive experiments to prove it work.
  * Write the research paper, make the project poster and present the presentation.
  
* Enhance Weakly Supervised Referring Image Segmentation with diffusion model (advised by Prof.Dimitrios Papadopoulos at DTU).
The model uses attention maps from a diffusion model to enhance image segmentation by focusing on relevant features based on linguistic cues. It employs a pyramid CNN architecture to integrate attention maps at multiple scales, improving segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for weakly supervised RES applications.
